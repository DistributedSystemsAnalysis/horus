# Introduction

Horus is a system that collects, organizes and enables the refinement of distributed system logs in a causally-consistent and scalable fashion. Horus leverages kernel-level probing to capture events for tracking causality between application-level logs from multiple sources. The events are then encoded as a directed acyclic graph and stored in a graph database, thus allowing the use of rich query languages to reason about runtime behavior.

# Repositories

Horus comprises a variety of software parts.
We split the entire system in the following repositories:

### [horus-events](https://github.com/DistributedSystemsAnalysis/horus-events)
Collection of Java serializers to forward events from Java applications to the Horus processor. The serializers follow a FlatBuffers specification, which is placed in Horus [Tracer](https://github.com/DistributedSystemsAnalysis/horus-tracer) repository.

### [horus-log4j-appender](https://github.com/DistributedSystemsAnalysis/horus-log4j-appender)
This repository is a custom Log4j Appender that forwards Log4j logs to Horus pipeline. This makes Java applications capable of storing log entries in Horus.

### [horus-tracer](https://github.com/DistributedSystemsAnalysis/horus-tracer)
The eBPF tracer used in Horus collects low level events related to socket communications and processes lifecycle. It is based on the state-of-the-art Falcon's tracer.

### [horus-event-consumer](https://github.com/DistributedSystemsAnalysis/horus-event-consumer)
This is the processing module of the Horus pipeline. Combines both processors of intra- and inter-process causal relationships.

### [horus-deployment](https://github.com/DistributedSystemsAnalysis/horus-deployment)
This repository contains a Docker deployment configuration of the entire Horus pipeline.

### [horus-neo4j-algo](https://github.com/DistributedSystemsAnalysis/horus-neo4j-algo)
This repository is a Neo4j plugin that includes procedures to perform efficient causal queries on causal graphs generated by Horus.

### [horus-benchmarks](https://github.com/DistributedSystemsAnalysis/horus-benchmarks)
This repository contains a set of synthetic benchmarks to evaluate scalability of Horus software parts.
